🎯 Object Detection with Audio Output: Empowering the Visually Impaired

📝 Project Overview : 
This project is an innovative solution designed to assist visually impaired and blind individuals. By combining real-time object detection with audio feedback and distance estimation, the system enables users to perceive their surroundings effectively and navigate safely.

✨ Features : 
1.	Real-Time Object Detection
2.	Detects and identifies objects using a pre-trained model.
3.	Audio Output
4.	Announces detected objects via real-time audio feedback.
5.	Distance Estimation
6.	Estimates and announces the proximity of detected objects.

🔧 Technologies Used : 
1.	COCO Dataset: Used to train and fine-tune the detection models.
2.	SSDMobileNet: Lightweight and efficient for real-time applications.
3.	RCNN: Offers higher accuracy for more complex object detection tasks.
4.	OpenCV: For processing video input and integrating detection.
5.	Python: Core programming language.


🌟 Benefits :
1.	Enhances accessibility for visually impaired individuals.
2.	Improves navigation safety with distance estimation.
3.	Offers a lightweight yet robust system for real-time use.

🚀 How It Works : 
1.	The system captures video input via a connected camera.
2.	Objects in the frame are detected using a SSDMobileNet or RCNN model trained on the COCO dataset.
3.	Identified objects are announced through an audio system.
4.	Distance to each detected object is calculated and relayed to the user.

🛠️ Setup and Installation : 
1.	Clone the repository: https://github.com/kunal-10-02/Object_Detection_project
2.	Install required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt  
3.	Run the application: python run_me.py 
 
📂 File Structure : 
1.	Detector.py: Main application script.
2.	run_me.py: Run whole application
3.	modelURL/: Pre-trained SSDMobileNet and RCNN models.
4.	README.md: Documentation.

🌐 Future Enhancements : 
Multi-language support for audio output.
Wearable device integration for on-the-go accessibility.
Crowd density analysis for better public space navigation.

🏆 Recognition :
